IPL 2025 Team Squad Information Dashboard using Power BI

ðŸ”§ Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, Excel

As part of my data visualization journey, I built an interactive IPL 2025 Team Squad Dashboard using Power BI to deliver quick insights into team compositions and player details.

Key Highlights:
âœ… Integrated two datasets: IPL Squad data and Team Logos
âœ… Used advanced visuals like Slicers, Cards, Tables, and Matrix to enhance interactivity
âœ… Designed dynamic filtering by team, player role, and nationality
âœ… Applied DAX measures to extract key stats and summaries
âœ… Created a clean, intuitive layout to make cricket data engaging and accessible

This dashboard combines my love for cricket with my skills in data visualization and storytelling. A great example of how sports and analytics can come together!
